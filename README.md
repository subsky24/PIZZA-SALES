## Pizza Sales Performance & Customer Demand Analysis

Project Description

This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover revenue trends, customer ordering behavior, and product performance. Using SQL for deep data analysis and Power BI for visualization, raw transactional data was transformed into actionable business insights.

The objective was to answer key business questions that support inventory planning, staffing decisions, promotional strategy, and product optimization not just to build charts.

Dataset Used

Pizza Sales Dataset

Transaction-level data containing:

Order dates and times

Pizza categories and sizes

Quantities sold

Revenue generated

The dataset spans a full year, enabling daily and monthly trend analysis.


Tools Used

SQL – data querying, aggregation, ranking, and KPI calculations

Power BI – data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboard design


Business Questions Asked

What is the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period?

What is the monthly trend of total orders throughout the year?

How are sales distributed across pizza categories?

How are sales distributed by pizza size?

Which pizzas are the top best sellers by:

Revenue

SQL Analysis

In SQL, I wrote a series of queries to gain granular insights into the business questions, including:

Daily and monthly aggregation of total orders

Revenue and quantity analysis by pizza category and size

Ranking pizzas to identify top and bottom performers

Calculation of core KPIs such as:

Total revenue

Average order value

Total orders

Total pizzas sold

These queries formed the analytical backbone of the project before visualization.
